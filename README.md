# Computer-Architecture---ARM-and-C
ARM and C projects from class

This repository contains my .c and .S files from my computer architecture class.

Do not open these if you are in the class. These are for my future employers to see my work; they are not for copying on assignments.

The assigments are not of my own making and were created by Dr. Owen at Michigan State University.
